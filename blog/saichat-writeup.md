## A quick Q/A

> What is Saichat?

Saichat is a rudimentary chat application written in C that Leo Molina and I wrote as an assignment for the class Operating System Principles, taught by Professor Peter Bui. The application doesn't really have much to do with the CTF; it is just the starting point.

> What is a CTF?

A CTF is a **C**apture **T**he **F**lag challenge where the author hides a special string called a "flag" inside some kind of file or server. To retrieve the flag, you typically apply some cybersecurity or software reverse engineering concept to extract the string from the file or server. CTF challenges are meant to be instructive. Good ones generally exercise one's knowledge of computer science concepts in a way that promotes problem solving through self-discovery.

If you'd like an in-depth explanation of this challenge and how to solve it, continue reading. If you want to try to solve the CTF without the help of this walkthrough, read the section [Starting the puzzle](#starting-the-puzzle) and then stop reading.

## Starting the puzzle

*It goes without saying, but don't download and run software from strangers. Proceed at your own risk!*

Curl Saichat onto an x86 Linux machine, and make it executable with the following command:
```bash
curl https://irc.samneisewander.com/uploads/24ce1145dba46397/saichat > saichat && chmod +x ./saichat
```
Next, curl the pub/sub server this chat client communicates with:
```bash
curl https://irc.samneisewander.com/uploads/812b4230e94b10db/mq_server.py > mq_server.py
```
Now, start the pub/sub server:
```bash
python3 mq_server.py --port=9005
```
Finally, start Saichat:
```bash
./saichat
```
You you run into dependency problems, install the appropriate libraries using your distribution's package manager. (You can figure it out! You got this!)

Once the application is running, type in the address of the host running the server (this would be `localhost` if you are running `mq_server.py` per the instructions above), the port (likewise, this is `9005` if you followed the instructions above), and a username. Then, try sending the message "egg" to the server! This is the beginning of the puzzle.

If you get stuck from here on, read this article for guidance. Happy hunting! 🥚

## Solving the riddle
The riddle is a [reference](https://allpoetry.com/Fish-Riddle) to *The Lord of the Rings*. The answer is `fish`. Once you answer correctly, it should print a url.

## Solving the image
First of all, Naruto is the best manga ever. Second, this image is giving us a pretty crucial hint:

> Ah, a hacker. Do you know what a bitplane is?

(I've translated the l33tsp33k for you for convenience.)

### So what is a bitplane?

An image consists of pixels. Let's just consider one pixel.

The color of this pixel is determined by its *red*, *blue*, and *green* color channels (also called components). These components are just integer numbers that describe how much "redness" (or "greenness" or "blueness") the color has.

So I could have a pixel with components `(r: 55, g: 2, b: 128)`, and that looks like this:

![compositing a pixel from components](/assets/figure0.webp)

Could I have a pixel with components `(r: 1000000, g: 543, b: 894)`? Well, it kinda depends.

There is this concept called `bit-depth` which places a cap on how big our components can be. If our image has a bit-depth of 8 (sometimes said to be an "8-bit" image), that means that each component is represented using only 8 bits. Combinatorics tells us that you can create `2^8`, or `256` unique numbers using 8 bits, which means that we can choose one of 256 different amounts of red (and green, and blue) for our pixel.

So we *could* have a pixel like `(r: 1000000, g: 543, b: 894)` if we had a really high bit depth. But for now, let's imagine our pixel is part of an 8-bit image, meaning its components can range from 0 through 255, inclusive.

Taking our pixel, let's consider only its **red** component. In binary, it looks like this:

```js
00000000 // 0 in decimal
```

If I flip the rightmost bit, the decimal value goes from zero to one. Small change. Like who even cares.

```js
00000001 // 1 in decimal
```

But if I then flip the leftmost bit, the decimal value goes from one to *129*. Thats a big change!!!

```js
10000001 // 129 in decimal
```

We can observe here that the rightmost bit affects the final value the *least*, so we call it the *least significant bit*. In contrast, the leftmost bit affects the final value the *most*, so we call it the *most significant bit*. Relating this to color, flipping the least significant bit causes an almost imperceptible change the overall "redness" of this pixel, but flipping the most significant bit causes a very noticeable change in color.

Bitplanes are representations of an image that help us to visualize the effect of toggling different bits. To create one, we would would first chop our source image into its different color channels, like this:

![decomposing an image into color channels](/blogImages/saichat-writeup/figure1.webp)

Then, for each color channel, we would march over each bit index and make each pixel in the bitplane black or white based on whether the bit at that index is a one or a zero:

![decomposing a color channel into bitplanes](/blogImages/saichat-writeup/figure2.webp)

Here's an example of creating bitplane pixels from the green color channel of one pixel:

![decomposing a pixel's green channel into bitplane pixels](/blogImages/saichat-writeup/figure3.webp)

For an 8-bit image with 3 color channels, we would have `8 * 3 = 24` different bitplanes: one per bit per channel. 

Notice how the less significant bitplanes contain more noise than the more significant ones. This suggests that most of the *information* that makes the image visually distinct is found in the more significant bitplanes. If we were to replace the least significant bitplane with randomly generated noise and then reassemble the image, we probably wouldn't even notice that anything changed. This is a critical observation for the purposes of solving this CTF challenge.

### LSB Substitution

This section spoils the whole puzzle, so this is a good place to jump ship if you'd like to attempt to solve yourself.

The technique used to hide the flag inside this image is called **least significant bit (LSB) substitution**. Basically, if you can arbitrarily change the LSBs of any pixel in the image without it really changing the appearance at all, why not use those bits to hide a file or a message?

LSB substitution (and more generally any technique wherein you conceal data within other data) comes from a field called [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). One of the biggest practical applications of steganography is in digital watermarking, though it has also been used to [covertly smuggle information](https://codeanddagger.com/news/2018/8/2/engineer-allegedly-hid-stolen-files-in-photo-of-sunset).

You can plainly see that this image of Naruto is being used as a carrier for some hidden message by looking at the 0th red bitplane:

![naruto's 0th red bitplane](/blogImages/saichat-writeup/figure4.webp)

The noise pattern here is completely bizarre, and suggests that these bits have been tampered with. Based on this insight, we can write a small utility to extract the LSBs from the red channel of this image and assemble them into a binary dump. Inspecting this dump reveals that these bits are actually ASCII plaintext containing the flag!

I'm not going to show you what's hidden in the image, as that would ruin the fun. If you've read this far, try extracting the LSBs yourself!
